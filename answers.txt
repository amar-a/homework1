What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge is when you are updating from a local repository to a working directory, or rather, when the target branch is public. Merging can result in conflicts.

Rebase is when you want to update the start of your branch to a later commit that happend after you branched out. It has a linear structure and is typically used when the target branch is private.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version of your changes that are hosted on an external server.
